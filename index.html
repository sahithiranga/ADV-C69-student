                <p> Frozen 1 Plot: When their kingdom becomes trapped in perpetual winter, fearless Anna joins forces with mountaineer Kristoff and his reindeer sidekick to find Anna's sister, Snow Queen Elsa, and break her icy spell. Although their epic journey leads them to encounters with mystical trolls, a comedic snowman, harsh conditions, and magic at every turn, Anna and Kristoff bravely push onward in a race to save their kingdom from winter's cold grip. Frozen 2 Plot: Elsa the Snow Queen has an extraordinary gift -- the power to create ice and snow. But no matter how happy she is to be surrounded by the people of Arendelle, Elsa finds herself strangely unsettled. After hearing a mysterious voice call out to her, Elsa travels to the enchanted forests and dark seas beyond her kingdom -- an adventure that soon turns into a journey of self-discovery. Frozen II is funny, exciting, sad, romantic, and silly. The settings are gorgeously imagined and wonderfully inviting. We learn family secrets, some comforting, some painful. Characters confront some of the most daunting human questions about loss, change, trust and how we can best heal the wounds of the past.The sequel goes deeper into Elsa and Anna's background in new ways and brings out heavier themes in the narrative, stronger consequences making it stronger generally than the original one. The original film was absolutely stunning but it gets better in the sequel with even more stunning water bodies, ice sculptures and the major transformation that Elsa goes through giving us the opportunity to experience her powers in a more intense way. In frozen 1 we saw more of Anna’s adventure story along with kristoff, Olaf and skev which was hilarious and sweet and now we get to have a five some with Elsa included which makes the storyline even more interesting. The sequel goes deeper into Elsa and Anna’s background in new ways and brings out heavier themes in the narrative, stronger consequences making it stronger generally than the original one.</p>

                <p>After growing up suffering neglect and criticism from his father, a young man's world is turned upside down when he learns that he was switched at birth with a millionaire's son. Bantu grows up being constantly subjected to his father's scorn. Learning of his real parentage, he decides to carve a place for himself within the family he truly belongs to.This trait of telling the truth lands Bantu in some strange, and often hilarious, sequences where the other characters are dumbfounded by his straightforwardness. However, in Ala Vaikunthapurramloo, he takes a detour from this path and focuses more on the emotional drama between the characters. More than the witty lines and humour, it’s the depth in the emotional conversations between characters that leave a strong impression. Ala Vaikuntapuramlo is amazingly beautiful. The entire team has put in lot of efforts and taken care of minute details in giving us this wholesome entertainer. It's got action, emotion, comedy, music and a fresh story that is far from cliches. Each scene in the movie is Out and Out mindblowing. The dialogues and the funny scenes in the movie make us stay glued to the screen. Points like comedy timing, stylish look , dance, acting etc were amazing in this movie. </p>

                <p>Baahubali 2 was ranked 2nd best in India. Baahubali 1 and 2 are avalible in many different languages. It's refreshing to see these characters, who are often seemingly painted as paragons of virtue and vice, have their wills tested by various trials—and sometimes fail. These momentary weaknesses sometimes indicate character flaws, as in Bhalla's case. But they also sometimes suggest that good people can make big mistakes. The film's refusal to judge character solely based on how they respond to mitigating circumstances is refreshing. Bahubali 1 summary: In the kingdom of Mahishmati, while pursuing his love, Shivudu learns about the conflict ridden past of his family and his legacy. He must now prepare himself to face his newfound arch-enemy. Bahubali 2 summary: When Bhallaladeva conspires against his brother to become the king of Mahishmati, he has him killed by Katappa and imprisons his wife. Years later, his brother's son returns to avenge his father's death. </p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Recycling is important for making the environment a cleaner place, conserving materials, saving energy and reducing the amount of garbage in landfills. One of the most important benefits of recycling is the impact it has on the Earth. Recycling different materials helps the environment by reducing the use of natural resources. For example, recycling paper goods reduces the number of trees cut down each year. Recycling reduces the amount of materials placed in landfills and creates new products from many of these materials. Recycling has several benefits that help people and improve the environment. Producing recycled materials often requires less energy than creating entirely new goods and can help conserve energy. Recycling also saves energy by reducing the need for transportation of raw materials from their place of origin, which also decreases greenhouse gas emissions and emissions from vehicles transporting these materials. The pollution created by factories and industrial plants during the production process often reduces as a result of recycling. Recycling also saves many animals from interaction with plastic.</p>

In this beloved revised classic, beginning readers and budding astronomers are launched on a wild trip to visit the eight planets in our solar system (per the International Astronomical Union’s 2006 decision to downgrade Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet), along with the Cat in the Hat, Thing One, Thing Two, Dick, and Sally. It’s a reading adventure that’s out of this world!<br>
